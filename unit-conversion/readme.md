Given a list of unit conversions, such as 1 foot equals 12 inches or 1 meter equals 1000 millimeters, write a program that can generally convert from one unit to another. Taken directly from the video:

example facts:
m = 3.28 ft
ft = 12 in
hr = 60 min
min = 60 sec
example queries:
2 m = ? in    --> answer = 78.72
13 in = ? m   --> answer = 0.330 (roughly)
13 in = ? hr  --> "not convertible"
